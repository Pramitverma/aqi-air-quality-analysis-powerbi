## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes **day-wise AQI data** to evaluate:
- Overall air quality conditions across Indian cities and states
- Severity distribution using AQI categories
- Dominant pollutants contributing to air pollution
- Temporal patterns across months and years
- High-risk cities with consistently poor air quality

The dashboard is designed as a **decision-support and monitoring tool** for:
- Environmental analysts  
- Policy makers  
- Researchers  
- Data analysts  

---

## ❓ Business Problem

Air pollution poses serious risks to **public health, urban planning, and sustainability**.

Key challenges addressed:
- Identifying **most polluted cities and regions**
- Understanding **which pollutants drive AQI**
- Tracking **AQI trends over time**
- Monitoring **changes across seasons and years**
- Categorizing air quality for public awareness

This project answers:
- Which cities consistently record poor AQI?
- What pollutants are most responsible?
- How does air quality vary geographically and temporally?

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Day-wise AQI Dataset (Excel)
- **Time Span:** Multi-year data (2015–2025)
- **Granularity:** Daily AQI readings per city
- **Coverage:** Multiple Indian states, cities, and monitoring areas

### Key Fields
- AQI Value
- AQI Category (Good → Hazardous)
- Prominent Pollutant (PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃)
- City, State, Area
- Date, Month, Year
- Number of Monitoring Stations

---

## 🎨 Dashboard Design & Layout

The dashboard follows a **dark-mode analytical theme** optimized for readability and severity highlighting.

**Design Principles:**
- Dark background to reduce visual noise
- Color-coded AQI severity scale (Green → Maroon)
- Z-pattern layout for intuitive navigation
- Clear separation between KPIs, trends, and breakdowns

---

## 📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)

- Average AQI
- Maximum AQI Recorded
- AQI Category (Overall Status)
- Primary Pollutant
- City-wise Average AQI
- Pollutant Occurrence Frequency

---

## 📊 Dashboard Components & Insights

### 1️⃣ AQI Summary (Gauge Chart)
- Displays **average AQI = 119**
- AQI Category: **Poor**
- Maximum AQI observed: **500**
- Primary pollutant identified: **PM10**

➡ Instantly communicates national air quality status

---

### 2️⃣ Average AQI by Area (Bar Chart)
Top polluted cities include:
- **Loni Ghaziabad**
- **Jharsuguda**
- **Gurgaon**
- **Delhi**
- **Ghaziabad**

➡ Highlights cities requiring urgent intervention

---

### 3️⃣ AQI Level by City (Donut Chart)
Distribution across AQI categories:
- Moderate
- Poor
- Unhealthy
- Very Unhealthy
- Hazardous

➡ Shows majority of readings fall in **Moderate to Poor** range

---

## 🧪 Pollutant Analysis

### Pollutant Occurrence Frequency
- **PM10** – Highest occurrence
- **PM2.5** – Second highest contributor
- Followed by CO, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃

➡ Indicates pollution largely driven by:
- Vehicular emissions
- Construction dust
- Industrial activities

---

## 🗺️ Geospatial & Trend Analysis

### AQI by State (Map Visualization)
- Bubble map plots AQI severity across India
- Bubble size indicates AQI value
- Color indicates AQI category

➡ Identifies **regional pollution hotspots**

---

### Time Trend Analysis
- Line chart shows AQI variation over months
- Seasonal spikes observed in certain periods

➡ Helps understand **weather and seasonal impact**

---

## 🎛 Filters & Interactivity

Interactive slicers included:
- **Year**
- **State**
- **Area**
- **Month Name**

These allow:
- Drill-down analysis
- City-level inspection
- Time-based comparisons

---

## ▶ How to Use This Dashboard

1. Open `AQI_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
2. Load or refresh the dataset if required
3. Use filters to explore specific years, states, or cities
4. Analyze AQI severity, pollutant dominance, and trends
5. Identify high-risk regions and seasonal patterns

---

## ✅ Final Insights & Recommendations

- PM10 and PM2.5 are the **primary drivers of poor air quality**
- Urban and industrial regions show **consistently high AQI**
- Seasonal spikes suggest **policy-driven mitigation during peak months**
- City-level monitoring enables targeted environmental action

This dashboard can support:
- Environmental monitoring
- Public awareness reporting
- Policy and urban planning decisions
